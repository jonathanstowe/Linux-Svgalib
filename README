Linux::Svgalib
==============

This module provides a Perl interface to svgalib - a library of graphics
routines that work in the Linux virtual console. 

There is an existing module called 'vga' that provides similar facilities -
the major difference being that this module provides a vaguely object
oriented interface and attempts to make it easier to work with some
of the svgalib functions that return or take as arguments C datatypes that
are sometimes difficult to work with in Perl.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

Because of the way in which svgalib works you will almost certainly need to
become the superuser before running 'make test' - infact on most systems
you will either need to be the superuser or have created a setuid program
to use this module properly at all.

DEPENDENCIES

This module obviously requires svgalib in order to build.  It has been
tested with version 1.4.2 of the library but it doesnt appear that the
API has changed since about 1.2 so anything since then should work but
I am not going to make any guarantees about that.

As far as I know svgalib only works on x86 linux - but I dont have any
alternative hardware on which to test this assertion.
