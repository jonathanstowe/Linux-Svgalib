Linux::Svgalib
==============

This module provides a Perl interface to svgalib - a library of graphics
routines that work in the Linux virtual console. 

There is an existing module called 'vga' that provides similar facilities -
the major difference being that this module provides a vaguely object
oriented interface and attempts to make it easier to work with some
of the svgalib functions that return or take as arguments C datatypes that
are sometimes difficult to work with in Perl.

## INSTALLATION

** N.B.  The svgalib operates at a fairly low level and may not be
compatible with certain hardware or other running software, do not
install it on a system that you can't reboot without warning **

To install this module type the following:

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test
	make install

Because of the way in which svgalib works you will almost certainly need to
become the superuser before running 'make test' - infact on most systems
you will either need to be the superuser or have created a setuid program
to use this module properly at all, it is also unlikely to work at all
from within an X terminal window of some sort.

## DEPENDENCIES

This module obviously requires svgalib in order to build, unless you
have built the library from source then you may have to install the
'devel' package as well in what ever way is provided on your system.
It has been tested with version 1.4.2 of the library but it doesnt appear
that the API has changed since about 1.2 so anything since then should
work but I am not going to make any guarantees about that.

As far as I know svgalib only works on x86 linux - but I dont have any
alternative hardware on which to test this assertion.

## SUPPORT

As most PC hardware has moved beyond what is supported by this library
it is difficult to know whether it works properly or at all, or even 
how to test it. It compiles though.

If you are lucky enough to have hardware that it supports and you find
it has a problem, please send a patch or report via the github:
